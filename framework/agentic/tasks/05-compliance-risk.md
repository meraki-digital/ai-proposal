## Development Guidelines

### Identifying Risks

**Comprehensive Risk Identification:**
- Review all previous proposal documents for clues
- Consider: What could go wrong? What's uncertain? What's outside your control?
- Use checklists from past projects
- Brainstorm with experienced PMs and technical leads
- Consider risks across all categories

**Common Risk Sources:**
- Aggressive schedule
- Incomplete design or scope definition
- Dependencies on client or third parties
- New or unproven methods
- Resource constraints
- Weather and site conditions
- Regulatory approvals
- Supply chain issues
- Labor availability
- Unclear requirements

### Risk Assessment

**Be Honest:**
- Don't downplay risks to look good
- Clients appreciate transparency
- Better to identify and mitigate than be surprised

**Be Realistic:**
- Use actual data from past projects
- Don't assume best-case scenarios
- Probability and impact should be defensible

**Prioritize:**
- Focus mitigation resources on highest-score risks
- Don't try to mitigate everything
- Accept low-priority risks that cost more to mitigate than their expected value

### Mitigation Planning

**Effective Mitigation:**
- Specific actions, not vague statements
- Assigned ownership
- Reasonable cost relative to risk magnitude
- Actually executable (not theoretical)

**Types of Mitigation:**
- Preventive: Reduce probability (training, planning, testing)
- Protective: Reduce impact (insurance, buffers, backup plans)
- Contingency: Pre-planned response if risk occurs

### Compliance Development

**Understand Requirements:**
- Research applicable regulations thoroughly
- Review client's compliance requirements document if provided
- Check `./templates/compliance-requirements.md` for standards
- Consult regulatory experts if needed

**Demonstrate Capability:**
- Show you understand the regulations
- Prove you have compliant systems in place
- Provide evidence (certifications, past performance, metrics)
- Identify and address any gaps
