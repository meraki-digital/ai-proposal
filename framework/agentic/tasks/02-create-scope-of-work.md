# Task 02: Create Scope of Work

## Purpose
Transform discovery insights into a clear, detailed Scope of Work (SOW) that defines exactly what will be delivered, what's excluded, and the assumptions and constraints that govern the project.

## Context
This document becomes the contractual foundation of your proposal. It must be clear, comprehensive, and aligned with both client needs and your company's capabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Step 1 (Discovery)
- `<proposal-id>-opportunity-brief.md` exists
- `<proposal-id>-requirements-analysis.md` exists
- Optional: `./company/capabilities.md` for reference to company strengths

## Output
- `<proposal-id>-scope-of-work.md` - Comprehensive scope definition

---

## Development Guidelines

### Writing the Scope

**Be Specific:**
- Use concrete, measurable language
- Avoid vague terms like "appropriate," "reasonable," "as needed"
- Quantify wherever possible (quantities, durations, specifications)

**Be Complete:**
- Cover all aspects of the work
- Don't assume client knows what's included
- Address edge cases and boundary conditions

**Be Clear:**
- Use simple, direct language
- Define technical terms
- Organize logically
- Use tables and bullets for readability

**Be Realistic:**
- Don't over-promise
- Build in reasonable buffers
- Acknowledge uncertainties
- Align with company capabilities

### Leveraging Company Assets

**Reference Past Projects:**
- Check `./company/past-projects/` for similar work
- Use proven methodologies and approaches
- Cite relevant experience

**Align with Capabilities:**
- Review `./company/capabilities.md`
- Ensure scope matches company strengths
- Highlight differentiators
- Don't commit to capabilities you don't have

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Scope creep:** Being too generous with "includes" without clear boundaries
- **Ambiguity:** Leaving room for interpretation on critical items
- **Over-complexity:** Making simple work sound complicated
- **Under-specification:** Not providing enough detail to price or execute
- **Misalignment:** Scope that doesn't match client requirements or evaluation criteria
- **Missing exclusions:** Failing to call out what's NOT included

## Next Steps

After completing the Scope of Work:
1. **Review internally** with technical leads and estimators
2. **Validate assumptions** with client if possible
3. **Proceed to Step 3** (Project Plan) using this scope as the foundation
4. **Use scope to drive budget development** in Step 4

The Scope of Work becomes the reference point for all remaining proposal activities.
