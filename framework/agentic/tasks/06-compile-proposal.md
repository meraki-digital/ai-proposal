## Compilation Guidelines

### Storytelling & Flow

**Create a Narrative:**
- Don't just compile documents - tell a story
- Opening: We understand your needs
- Middle: Here's our solution and why we're qualified
- Close: Partner with us for success

**Logical Progression:**
- Each section builds on the previous
- Executive summary hooks them, body proves it, conclusion closes
- Use transitions between sections

**Client-Centric Language:**
- Focus on client benefits, not just your features
- Use "you" and "your" to address the client
- Mirror their language from RFP or conversations

### Professional Presentation

**Formatting:**
- Consistent headings, fonts, spacing
- Professional tables and formatting
- Page numbers, headers/footers
- Table of contents with page references
- If converting to PDF, ensure all formatting preserved

**Visual Elements:**
- Consider adding: org charts, schedule graphics, site plans, photos of past projects
- Use visuals to break up text and enhance understanding
- Ensure any graphics are high quality and professional

**Branding:**
- Company logo and branding elements
- Consistent color scheme if applicable
- Professional cover page

### Content Balance

**Main Proposal vs. Appendices:**
- Main proposal: Compelling narrative, key information, executive-digestible
- Appendices: Supporting detail, evidence, compliance documentation
- Typical main proposal: 20-40 pages; Appendices: variable based on requirements

**Right Level of Detail:**
- Enough to demonstrate competence and thoroughness
- Not so much that key points are buried
- Assume executive will read main proposal, specialists will review appendices

### Quality Control

**Completeness Check:**
- [ ] Addresses every requirement in client's RFP or request
- [ ] All evaluation criteria covered
- [ ] All required certifications and documentation included
- [ ] No TBDs in final version (fill in or remove)

**Accuracy Check:**

- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] All dates realistic and aligned

**Polish:**

Weave these themes consistently through each section to reinforce your differentiators.

## Compliance with RFP Requirements

| [Section 3.1] | [Requirement] | [Section X, Page Y] | ✓ |

This helps client evaluators find information and shows you addressed everything.
