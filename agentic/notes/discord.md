## Handoff vs Checkpoint
I have created a command for my agents.md file that allows me to create a Checkpoint file.  It's very much like "Handoff", or seems to me to be very much like it.

I type the word "Checkpoint" in Amp (or other Agentic chat). The agent summarizes the current thread in a format suitable for beginning a new thread. It puts the summary in a checkpoints folder inside my repo with versioned filename.

I have a companion command for a new thread. "Restart".  When that command is run, the agent discerns which default Checkpoint to present me with. The currently open file if I have one open, or the latest one based on the versioned naming convention. I am prompted to reply Yes for the presented default, enter a filename for a different one, or No to cancel the restart from Checkpoint.

## Context Window
I use Amp almost all day long at this point. I bounce back and forth between Smart and Free. I used Free so much a few times that it cuts me off and tells me I have exceeded Free capacity and I need to return in a few hours.

I'm not sure what sort of fuel tank is being consumed to make that determination. Tokens used, time spent, etc. But, it would be nice if I could periodically check my status or if it would occasionally message me about my status (50% used or  90% used, consider Handoff ). Some clarity around that would be awesome.

## Command Palette
I have seen on some videos that the forward slash has been removed in favor of some other way to launch a Command Palette (VS Code on a Mac specifically). I don't know that the new way is, but slash still seems to pull up an Amp Palette for me. Also, is there a mechanism by which I can add my own customizations to that palette?
