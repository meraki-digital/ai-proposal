# Mod 0003 - AI Questions Library Management UI

## Initial Concept
Build a full CRUD interface for all of the supporting tables. These include:
- public.accounts
- public.jobs
- public.managers
- public.regions
- public.system_variables
- core.ai_example_questions
- care.ai_question_categories


## Problem Statement

Users need to be able to view, organize, edit, or delete this information. The admin page navigation exists but leads to an empty placeholder and that nav url is too specific as it was originally built for ai_questions only.

## Desired Outcome

A functional admin interface where users can:
- View these tables in a table/list
- Create new entries
- Edit existing entries
- Delete entries
- Search/filter entries
- See metadata (created date, last used, etc.)

## Backend Status

The backend API already exists from mod 0001:
- GET /admin/ai-questions - list all questions
- POST /admin/ai-questions - create new question
- PUT /admin/ai-questions/{id} - update question
- DELETE /admin/ai-questions/{id} - delete question
- This backend work covers ai-questions only but is an example for the others.

## What Needs to be Built

Frontend only:
- Fetch and display data
- Forms for create/edit with validation
- Delete confirmation modal
- Search/filter functionality
- Responsive table/card layout
