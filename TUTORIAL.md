# Tutorial: From Idea to Shipped Product

## This Looks Complicated. It's Not.

You're looking at this repo and seeing:
- 6 numbered steps
- SRS, PRD, seeds, explainers
- Checkpoints, bug fixes, task lists
- Folders within folders

And you're thinking: **"This is too much."**

## Here's the Truth

You follow a **guided path**. Everything else is there *when you need it*.

You don't need to understand the whole framework upfront. You just need to start with three words: **"Do Step 1"**

The AI agent handles the rest, asking questions, creating documents, and guiding you forward—one step at a time.

## See It In Action

We built a complete example project to show you exactly how this works. It's a simple Reading List Tracker app that went from a vague idea to a working product using this framework.

**Every single step is documented.** Every decision. Every generated file. Every choice made along the way.

## Your Next Step

Switch to the `tutorial` branch and open this file again:

```bash
git checkout tutorial
```

Then come back here. You'll see the complete journey from "I want to track my reading" to a shipped product—with commentary explaining what happened at each step and why.

After walking through the tutorial, you'll understand:
- How the 6 steps flow naturally from one to another
- When to use seeds, explainers, and checkpoints
- How to work with AI agents effectively
- Why you end up in a great place every time

## Ready?

```bash
git checkout tutorial
```

See you there.
